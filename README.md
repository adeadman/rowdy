A [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) based JSON Web Token authentication server.

## Requirements

Rocket requires nightly Rust. You should probably install Rust with [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/), then override the code directory to use nightly instead of stable. See
[installation instructions](https://rocket.rs/guide/getting-started/#installing-rust).
